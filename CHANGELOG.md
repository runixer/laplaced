and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **People Graph** — the bot now tracks people mentioned in conversations with bios, circles, and aliases
- **Inner Circle in context** — system prompt includes people from Family and Work_Inner circles for better personalization
- **search_people tool** — Laplace can search for people by name, username, or description
- **manage_people tool** — update, delete, or merge people records through chat commands
- **Forwarded message extraction** — people are automatically extracted from forwarded messages with their Telegram ID and username
- **People Debug UI** — new `/ui/debug/people` page to view all people grouped by circle
- **Reranker people support** — relevant people are now included in RAG context alongside topics

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-10

**Architecture release: Unified agent framework and template-based prompts.**

### Added
- **Unified agent architecture** — all LLM-powered operations now use consistent `agent.Agent` interface with typed parameters
- **SharedContext** — user profile and recent topics passed between agents, avoiding redundant DB queries
- **Centralized test mocks** — `internal/testutil/` package with `MockStorage`, `MockAgent`, and test fixtures
- **MockAgent** — enables testing of agent-dependent code without LLM calls

### Changed
- **Agent migration** — Laplace, Reranker, Enricher, Splitter, Merger, Archivist moved to `internal/agent/` with dedicated packages
- **Named templates** — all i18n prompts migrated from positional `%s` to named `{{.Name}}` placeholders for type safety
- **RAG modularization** — monolithic `rag.go` split into focused modules: retrieval, consolidation, session, processing, extraction, vector
- **Test architecture** — centralized mocks reduce duplication, `.Maybe()` pattern handles background loop side effects

### Removed
- **Deduplicator remnants** — removed unused `DeduplicatorParams` and `memory.consolidation_prompt`

### Fixed
- **All tests passing** — previously skipped tests now work with MockAgent integration

## [0.4.8] - 2026-01-09

**Agent Debug UI: Full visibility into LLM conversations.**

### Added
- **Agent Debug UI** — unified visualization for all agents showing full OpenRouter API requests/responses with syntax-highlighted JSON
- **Multi-turn conversation viewer** — collapsible accordions showing all LLM iterations for Laplace (tool calls) and Reranker (agentic loop)
- **Reranker hallucination filter** — detects and removes invalid topic IDs returned by LLM, with dedicated metric

### Changed
- **Prompt structure improved** — system prompt sections reordered for better LLM comprehension, enhanced XML formatting

### Fixed
- **Tests restored** — 13 tests temporarily skipped in v0.4.7 now working again
- **Telegram reactions** — fixed invalid emoji causing API errors

### Removed
- **Deduplicator agent** — removed non-functional fact deduplication logic (~400 lines)

## [0.4.7] - 2026-01-08

**FIFO message processing, prompt engineering updates, and stability fixes.**

### Changed
- **Archivist prompt restructured** — XML tags for sections, clearer output format specification (per Google prompting guidelines).

### Fixed
- **Race condition with sequential messages** — when a user sends multiple messages in quick succession (e.g., voice + text), the bot now processes them in strict FIFO order. Previously, a fast-to-process message could finish before a slow one (like a long voice memo), causing the bot to respond out of order.
- **Reranker JSON parsing** — Fixed parsing error when LLM wraps the JSON response in an array.
- **Tool usage hallucinations** — Fixed bot outputting raw JSON for memory updates instead of calling the `manage_memory` tool (added explicit prohibition in system prompt and tool description).
- **Fact extraction deadlock** — Fixed extraction blocked by consolidation deadlock; merged topics (`is_consolidated=true`) now proceed immediately, orphan topics without merge partners are auto-marked as checked.

### Internal
- **Tests** — Temporarily skipped regression tests for `ProcessMessageGroup` (Photo/PDF) and RAG `EnrichQuery` due to initialization panics. *Requires follow-up fix.*

## [0.4.6] - 2026-01-06

**Reranker optimization and maintenance tools.**

### Added
- **Recent topics in context** — system prompt now includes metadata about recent conversations (date, title, message count) for temporal awareness. Configurable via `rag.recent_topics_in_context`.
- **Database Maintenance UI** — new inspector `/ui/debug/database` for database health checks, repair, and splitting large topics.
- **Cross-User Contamination detection** — tools to identify and repair message leakage between users (caused by global auto-increment IDs).
- **Topic Splitter** — mechanism to break down oversized topics into smaller logical subtopics.
- **Max topic size** — added `max_merged_size_chars` config to prevent creating "black hole" topics during consolidation.
- **Maintenance Prompts** — new system prompts for "The Splitter" and updated prompts for "The Merger" (now aware of user profiles).
- **Optional excerpts** — new `ignore_excerpts` config to always use full topic content instead of reranker-generated excerpts

### Changed
- **Session timeout reduced** — default inactivity timeout for topic creation changed from 5h to 1h (`rag.chunk_interval`)
- **Split threshold configurable** — new `rag.split_threshold_chars` config option (default 25000 chars)
- **Splitter keeps message pairs** — user question and assistant response are never split into separate topics
- **Data Isolation Improvements** — refactored message retrieval in RAG service to prefer explicit topic-based lookups over raw ID ranges to reduce leakage risks.
- **SQLite Reliability** — explicit WAL mode setting via PRAGMA statements to ensure compatibility with modernc driver.
- **Excerpts disabled by default** — `ignore_excerpts: true` simplifies reranker prompt and improves reliability
- **Minimal thinking** — `thinking_level` default changed from "medium" to "minimal" for faster responses
- **Fewer topics** — `max_topics` default reduced from 15 to 5 for focused context

### Fixed
- Fixed broken "Context" link on Facts page — now links to associated Topic
- Improved contamination detection accuracy in dry-run mode
- Fixed multi-user repair to correctly isolate messages by user
- Overlapping topics now shown as clickable list in Database Maintenance UI

## [0.4.5] - 2026-01-05

**Multimodal RAG and prompt quality improvements.**

### Added
- **Multimodal RAG** — images and audio from user messages are now passed to enricher and reranker for better context understanding
- **Reasoning display** — Debug UI now shows Flash's internal thinking process for each reranker iteration
- **Target context budget** — configurable `target_context_chars` parameter guides Flash on output size

### Changed
- Reranker prompts completely restructured with XML sections, few-shot examples, and anti-laziness rules
- Increased `max_topics` default from 5 to 15 (Flash handles excerpts for large topics)
- Increased `timeout` default from 10s to 60s for more thorough analysis
- Added `turn_timeout` (30s default) for per-LLM-call timeout control
- Changed `thinking_level` default to "medium" for balanced speed/quality
- Prompts depersonalized for public release (example names changed)

### Fixed
- Soft validation for excerpts (warns on too short/long excerpts without blocking)
- Tool call payload monitoring (warns if >15 topics or >200K chars requested)

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-05

**Reranker protocol enforcement and excerpt quality improvements.**

### Added
- **Forced tool calling** — Flash must call `get_topics_content` before returning results (API-level enforcement via `tool_choice`)
- **Reasoning mode** — enabled `reasoning.effort: "low"` for better tool call decisions
- **Protocol violation detection** — fallback to vector search if Flash skips tool call

### Changed
- Improved excerpt quality rules:
  - Preserve User→Assistant message pairs
  - Don't truncate messages mid-sentence
  - Include 1-2 neighboring messages for context
- Fixed query enrichment prompt to prevent word substitution (e.g., "мениск" → "MinIO")

### Fixed
- JSON parsing now handles bare array format from Flash responses

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-04

**Reranker transparency: Understand why Flash chose each topic.**

### Added
- **Reason field** — Flash now explains why each topic was selected (1-2 sentences)
- **Excerpt field** — For large topics (>25K chars), Flash extracts only relevant messages instead of full content
- Reranker Debug UI shows reasons and excerpts in Selected Topics table
- Tooltip on candidate checkmarks shows selection reason

### Changed
- Updated reranker prompts to require reason for each selected topic
- Reranker response format changed from `[42, 18]` to `[{"id": 42, "reason": "..."}]`
- Backward compatibility maintained for old format parsing

## [0.4.1] - 2026-01-04

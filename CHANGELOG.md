## [Unreleased]

_Next version: v0.4 (Intelligence) — Flash Reranker, Memory Decay_

## [0.3.9] - 2026-01-04

**Final v0.3.x release. Establishes metrics baseline for v0.4 Intelligence features.**

### Added
- **System prompt tracking in context metrics** — `laplaced_bot_context_tokens_by_source{source="system"}` now tracks base system prompt size separately from profile facts. Enables complete context breakdown visualization (System + Profile + Session + Topics).
- **Job type classification for LLM metrics** — new `job_type` label distinguishes interactive user requests from background maintenance:
  - `job_type="interactive"` — user chat, tool calls (default)
  - `job_type="background"` — archiver, topic extraction, consolidation, fact extraction
  - Prevents background batch jobs (60s+ archiver operations) from skewing interactive latency metrics
  - Affects: `laplaced_llm_request_duration_seconds`, `laplaced_llm_requests_total`, `laplaced_llm_tokens_total`, `laplaced_llm_cost_usd_total`
  - New package `internal/jobtype` provides context-based job type propagation

### Changed
- Updated dependencies (BurntSushi/toml v1.6.0, modernc/libc v1.67.4)

### Documentation
- Added message processing flow architecture diagram (`docs/architecture/message-processing-flow.md`)
- Added Architectural Decisions section to `CLAUDE.md`

## [0.3.8] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Per-message latency breakdown metrics** for complete timing analysis:
  - `laplaced_bot_message_llm_duration_seconds{user_id}` — total LLM time per message (sum of all Tool Loop calls)
  - `laplaced_bot_message_llm_calls{user_id}` — number of LLM calls per message (1-10)
  - `laplaced_bot_message_tool_duration_seconds{user_id}` — total tool execution time per message
  - `laplaced_bot_message_tool_calls{user_id}` — number of tool calls per message
  - `laplaced_bot_message_telegram_duration_seconds{user_id}` — total Telegram send time per message
  - `laplaced_bot_message_telegram_calls{user_id}` — number of Telegram sends per message
  - `laplaced_bot_message_reaction_duration_seconds{user_id}` — SetMessageReaction timing
- **Source label for RAG latency metric** — `laplaced_rag_latency_seconds{user_id, source}` now distinguishes between `source="auto"` (buildContext) and `source="tool"` (search_history). Eliminates overlap in latency breakdown when search_history tool is used.
- **LLM anomaly tracking metric** — `laplaced_bot_llm_anomalies_total{user_id, type}` tracks empty responses, hallucination sanitizations, and retry outcomes

### Changed
- **Latency Breakdown chart** now uses per-message totals (File → RAG → LLM Total → Tool → Telegram) — sum should equal total processing time
- **Renamed tool `memory_search` → `search_history`** — clearer semantics, focuses on conversation history (topics), not facts (which are always in context). Improved prompt to trigger on explicit user requests like "search in memory", "find in history"
- **Added call limit to `internet_search` tool** — maximum 3 calls per response to prevent runaway tool generation

### Fixed
- **Tool model calls (Perplexity) now track user_id** — previously recorded as `user_id="0"`, now correctly attributed to the requesting user
- **LLM response sanitization** — prevents hallucination artifacts (like `</tool_code>`, `</s>`) and runaway JSON block generation from being sent to users. Gemini sometimes hallucinates special tokens followed by endless JSON queries.
- **Empty LLM response retry** — automatically retries up to 2 times when model returns empty response (0 completion tokens). Logs detailed info: `finish_reason`, model, token counts. Fixes rare Gemini bug where model responds with `finish_reason=stop` but 0 tokens.
- **Telegram metrics now recorded on early returns** — previously `message_telegram_duration_seconds` and `message_telegram_calls` were lost when LLM returned errors

## [0.3.7] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **New metrics for full latency breakdown:**
  - `laplaced_file_download_duration_seconds{user_id, file_type}` — Telegram file download timing
  - `laplaced_file_downloads_total{user_id, file_type, status}` — download counter
  - `laplaced_file_size_bytes{file_type}` — file size histogram
  - `laplaced_rag_enrichment_duration_seconds{user_id}` — query enrichment LLM timing
- **Embedding type label** added to `laplaced_embedding_request_duration_seconds` and `laplaced_embedding_requests_total`:
  - `type=topics` for topic retrieval/processing embeddings
  - `type=facts` for fact retrieval embeddings

### Changed
- **Refactored file processing** into new `internal/files/` package:
  - **Parallel file downloads across message groups** — 5-8x speedup for photo albums
  - Automatic retries (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
  - Graceful degradation — continues with other files if one fails
  - Simplified `prepareUserMessage` by ~80 lines
- **Split CI workflows** to eliminate duplicate runs on release:
  - `ci.yml` — lint and test on push to main and PRs
  - `release.yml` — full release pipeline on tags only
- **Fixed GHCR image description** for multi-arch images by adding annotations at index level

## [0.3.6] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- Added `laplaced_user_info` gauge metric with labels `{user_id, username, first_name}` for Grafana label joins

### Fixed
- Fixed `laplaced_rag_latency_seconds` metric: was dead code (defined but never used), now properly records RAG retrieval time with `user_id` label
- Fixed Grafana user dropdown showing only active users — now uses `memory_facts_count` gauge (populated on startup for all users)

## [0.3.5] - 2026-01-03

### Changed
- **Improved memory extraction prompts** to prevent fact pollution:
  - Added "Zero Trust to Bot" protocol — facts extracted only from User messages, not Bot speculation
  - Added "Silence ≠ Consent" rule — Bot's unanswered hypotheses are not saved as facts
  - Added "No Psychology" rule — no interpretation of feelings, only actions
  - Added "Identity Protection" — prevents merging people with similar names (e.g., Roman P. vs Roman L.)
  - Removed aggressive consolidation instruction that caused data loss
- **Voice messages now quote full transcription** in Bot's response:
  - LLM must quote cleaned voice content with `> 🎤` prefix
  - Forwarded voice messages attributed as `> 🎤 **From [sender]:** [text]`
  - Enables archivist and RAG to work with voice message content

### Added
- Added storage metrics for database observability:
  - `laplaced_storage_size_bytes` - total database file size
  - `laplaced_storage_table_bytes{table}` - per-table size via SQLite dbstat
  - `laplaced_storage_cleanup_deleted_total{table}` - count of deleted rows during cleanup
  - `laplaced_storage_cleanup_duration_seconds{table}` - cleanup operation duration
- Added automatic retention cleanup (runs hourly with metrics update):
  - `fact_history`: keeps 100 most recent records per user
  - `rag_logs`: keeps 20 most recent records per user
  - Reclaims ~263 MB (54% of DB) on first run for existing installations

### Fixed
- Fixed missing `user_id` label on `laplaced_memory_topics_total` metric (missed in v0.3.3)
- Fixed missing `user_id` label on `laplaced_memory_facts_count` and `laplaced_memory_staleness_days` metrics
- Removed dead code: unused `factsTotal` gauge and `UpdateFactsTotal` function in memory/metrics.go

## [0.3.4] - 2026-01-02

### Changed
- **Voice messages now use native Gemini audio understanding** instead of Yandex SpeechKit transcription
  - Audio is sent directly to the LLM as base64-encoded OGG Opus
  - Supports any language Gemini understands (not limited to Russian)
  - No external speech recognition service required
  - Yandex SpeechKit integration is now optional/unused
  - Includes explicit instruction for LLM to respond in configured language and avoid reasoning leakage

### Added
- Added `laplaced_build_info{version, go_version}` metric for version tracking in Grafana

  - Embedding: `laplaced_embedding_request_duration_seconds`, `laplaced_embedding_requests_total`, `laplaced_embedding_tokens_total`, `laplaced_embedding_cost_usd_total`
  - Bot: `laplaced_bot_context_tokens_by_source`
- Fixed `laplaced_memory_topics_total` metric always showing 0
- Fixed histogram buckets for `laplaced_bot_message_processing_duration_seconds`: extended from 30s to 120s max (LLM responses can take up to a minute)
